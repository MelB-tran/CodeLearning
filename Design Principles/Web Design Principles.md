### Purpose
### Communication
### Typefaces
### Colors
### Images
### Navigation
### Grid-Based Layouts
Arranging content into well-defined sections (columns, rows) 
### "F" Pattern Design
Cultures that read from left to right, used to looking at webpages in this order too, design like that, where
the most important is the first side users would see
### Load Time
Tips for better load time - optimize image size (size and scale), central CSS & JS files, compressing HTML, CSS, Javascript
### Mobile Friendly
(from experience) design webpage from a mobile-first standpoint. Responsive layouts, or dedicated mobile sites (what tools are available for this?)
