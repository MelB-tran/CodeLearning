#From "Becoming an Outlier: Reprogramming the Developer Mind"
Plurasight course - "Explore the habits and career tactics that create remarkable developers. Take control of your career, and set yourself apart from the pack. Become an Outlier."

## The Outlier Motivation
Outlier - thinks outside the box etc, do work that matters to you 

### The Transformation
Three practices that keep you
1. Not enough time to learn and practice (Mod 1)
2. People don't respect the skills we have (Mod 2)
3. We let chance dictate the trajectory of our careers (Mod 3)

## Module 1: Command Your Time
Success measured roughly by the value you bring to others. Many ways to maximize your number

### Habits
"I'm not a great programmer, I'm just a good programmer with great habits"
Habits are a *choice*. Search for habits that are making you stagnant, and change them (where you can)
*Activity:* write down bad habits and their "good" hom√≥logos

### Deliberate Practice
- Doing things you're *not* good at
- Striving to improve
- Evaluation your performance **

### Seven Facets of Life
Rank 1 to 7: Health, Family, Job, Self Dev., Civic, Religion/Spirituatilty, Recreation
pay attention to the bottom few - these are opportunities to gain time for what's most important (?)
Run each obligation thru a "is this en lo que deberia pasar mi tiempo/aligns with priorities?" filter *Default to no*

Accomplishing tasks in two or more areas at the same to minimize sacrifices made (hmm pero how?) Examples:
1. Commute (can't, cause I drive, ask to telecommute once a week? podcasts for skills I wanna get better at) [audiobook recs](http://outlierdeveloper.com/audiobooks/)
2.
