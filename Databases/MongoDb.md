# Mongo Db

*started may 2016*

- MongoDB can use a JSON object where a single object with diff fields can be used
- "efficiently" support common data-access models
- not predicated on joining diff tables like in SQL
- Natively supports "scaling out" (data spread across different similar-sized servers?)
- BSON - binary json (??)
