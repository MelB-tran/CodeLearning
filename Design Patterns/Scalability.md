##Scalability in coding

From [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9420014/what-does-it-mean-scalability)
"Scalability is the ability of a program to scale. For example, if you can do something on a small database (say less than 1000 records), a program that is highly scalable would work well on a small set as well as working well on a large set (say millions, or billions of records).

It would have a linear growth of resource requirements
- Big-O notation for more details about how programs can require more computation the larger the data input gets. 
	Something parabolic like Big-O(x^2) is far less efficient with large x inputs than something linear like Big-O(x)"
