## Solid Principles of Object-Oriented design    
SRP - Single Responsibility Principle is about ev object having a single responsibility, which should be entirely "encapsulated" in the class - meaning it shouldn't have to use other classes to carry out diff responsibilities. Not dependent.

### Cohesion and Coupling
Ev program/app should strive for high cohesion and lo coupling, where  
- Cohesion is how strongly-related and focuesd are the various responsibilities of a module
- Coupling is the degree to which each program module (classes sometimes) relies on the other modules

### Responsibilities
*definition* changes in behavior from client's pov - a reason to change, difference in usage scenarios  
Mapping:  
Requirements changes => responsibilities  
More responsibilities => more likelihood of change  
Multiple responsibilities within a class => ?
More classes a change affects => more likely change will introduce errors

### Problem analysis
walk through a program that uses classes that depend on other parent classes, where the classes using them do not necessarily use, so any changes have a higher likelihood of introducing issues to the whole program.  
**Solution** multiple small interfaces that abstract out the functionality and also only have one responsibility. So the main programs use them as needed (stitch together), without any depending on the other. In this case, the "Online Order" class using diff itnerfaces that are relevant to the online ordering process

### Summary
- Following Single Responsibility Principle leads to lower coupling (each program module relying on other modules) and higher cohesion (strongly-related and focused responsibilities of a module)  
- Many small classes with distinct responsibilities => more flexibility
**Related Fundamentals (a continuaciï¿½n)**
- Open/Closed Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Separation of Concerns

## The Open/Closed Principle
*definition* software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc) should be open for extension but closed to  modification  
be able to extend with new functionality and classes without modifying the source 

### Overview
How do you change behavior without changing code exactly? Relying on abstractions. There's no limit to variety of implementations of each abstraction (how? more explanation needed)  
In .NET this can be accomplished with interfaces and abstract base classes, in procedural programming, some level of OCP can be achieved thru parameters (como?)
New classes are less likely to introduce new problems (no dependencies at first, no legacy coupling)
### Problem & Analysis
walk thru a "store checkout" program where the `Cart` class has a price calculation method that figures out the total to pay - with hardcoded values to calculate total amount, does all calculations within the same method, and no space to abstract it out
any changes to the fees or rates would require going into the source code and changing it, re-building/re-compiling, etc.  

### How to achieve
on top of being a "cart", this class also does pricing calculations. so you make an interface for this, which only calculates the price
```c#
public interface IPricingCalculator{
    decimal CalculatePrice(OrderItem item);
}
```
and each price rule is a diff class, based on this interface!
Diff scenarios are set up where a new class is added for each type of pricing, (buy 4 or 5 get 1 free) but the original cart class remains untouched. Method in `Cart` class where you get `total amount`
```c#
    public decimal TotalAmount(){
        var total = 0m;
        foreach(var orderItem in Items){ //Items is a public property in the class
            // _pricingCalculator is a implementation of the PricingCalculator class (which initializes a list of IPriceRule objects and has a "CalculatePrice" method that runs "calculatePrice" for each matched item)
            total += _pricingCalculator.CalculatePrice(orderItem);
            // more rules are coming
        }
        return total;
    }
```
the only code that really had to be touched was the "CalculatePrice" method inside each specific class inheriting `IPriceRule`

### Conclusions
Si sabes por propia experiencia that a particular type of change is likely to recur, you can use OCP as a pre-emptive measure  

if there's more than one change, refactor to achieve OCP  
no design can be closed to all changes tho
