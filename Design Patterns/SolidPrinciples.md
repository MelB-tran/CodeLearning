#Solid Principles of Object-Oriented design    
SRP - Single Responsibility Principle is about ev object having a single responsibility, which should be entirely "encapsulated" in the class - meaning it shouldn't have to use other classes to carry out diff responsibilities. Not dependent.

### Cohesion and Coupling
Ev program/app should strive for high cohesion and lo coupling, where  
- Cohesion is how strongly-related and focuesd are the various responsibilities of a module
- Coupling is the degree to which each program module (classes sometimes) relies on the other modules
